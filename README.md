### Interests

:fishsticks: **Git committer:** 

I have been participating in the Git community contribution since 2021. As an
11-year java developer, it is not easy to pick up the C language again, because
my usual work content is more complicated, but I am participating and growing as
much as possible.

My activities in Git Community: https://lore.kernel.org/git/?q=Teng+Long

:fishsticks: **Gerrit committer:**

In the process of implementing the distributed architecture of Gerrit in
Alibaba, I made some commits to the core of Gerrit. Gerrit is implemented in
Java, so it is more comfortable for me. However, due to the work focus, I have
little time to contribute, but I still pay close attention to the development of
Gerrit frequently.

My activities in Gerrit Community: http://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/q/dyroneteng@gmail.com
